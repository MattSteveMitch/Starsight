# Starsight
A game based loosely on the second book in the Skyward series by Brandon Sanderson. Be sure to install pygame before running.

I've been working on this project on-and-off for years ever since I mastered the basics of programming. It started out as a completely independent concept, but as it developed and I started to read the Skyward series, I started to give it more and more of a Skyward/Starsight theme. Thanks to my sister for insisting that I give the ship a light-lance after I changed its generic design to that of a Poco, and to my dad afterward for suggesting the concept of using the rocks as weapons against a mothership.

And yes, I do know about numpy, I learned about it early on in the process. The reason I don't use it in this game is because I couldn't quite get it to work at first, and I wanted to make my own vector functions anyway because I like math and physics. Since then I've never bothered to vectorize the functions because it doesn't seem to affect the performance.
